# Baletris
"Color block stacking puzzle" with a shop and random modifiers. For legal reasons I cannot say on which game this is based on. Vibecoded this during a lazy Sunday, expect bugs, broken CSS and dragons.

To play: [https://chameleon-lizard.github.io/baletris/](https://chameleon-lizard.github.io/baletris/)

## Controls:

```
z, x - rotate left and right
shift - hold
space - hard drop
arrows - move

```
